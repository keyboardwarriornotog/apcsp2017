	        	The picture above is a picture of my game. I created this game using the Scratch Application. The game is a maze that you must navigate a ball through without touching a wall. Additionally, you only have 60 seconds to complete the maze, so the game is a quite challenging one that requires patience and consistency.

	      		The pictures above are pictures of the app that I created using Michigan Institution of Technology's App Inventor 2. The app was created by myself and a classmate with the intention to be a source of knowledge that would help out anybody that needed conversions while they were cooking. We provided the conversions for temperature, volume, and weight.

	      	The picture above displays the code and text from my interactive story. The story called "Derek and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day." It was made by me, Daniel Jow, and my partner, Rick Kitada. We coded the entire game in Python through the website, repl.it. #Derek and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day #RagstoRiches
