    <p align="left" style="color:black; font-size:18px; font-family:Arial">My name is Daniel Jow. I was born on August 24, 2000 in Whittier, California, but I have lived in Rowland Heights my whole life. As of today's date, I am 2 days away from turning 17 years old. I am currently a senior at Rowland High School. My hobbies include singing, playing basketball, and playing video games. My life goal is to find God in everything I do so that when I look back at my life when I'm old, I can find peace in the fact that I pursued God with all of my heart.</p>
