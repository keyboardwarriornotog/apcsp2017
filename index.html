    This is my website that I created for my AP Computer Science Principles class. Through the course, I seek to learn about computers and technology as our society continues to develop into a highly technology-reliant one. Most of the things I post will be assignments from my class, but a few things will be added as a part of my own journey through learning about Computer Science.
